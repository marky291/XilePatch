        'Another teeny tiny week, introduction of the <b><a href="http://wiki.xileretro.net/index.php?title=Premium_Room" target="_blank">Premium Room</a></b>; An area where you gain exclusive access to an area of the server meant as a gift to those who chose to donate and support us. Its nothing pay2win, anything gained there is cosmetic and still requires effort on the players end. Discount Elite Weapons and Low-Cost Useables are the only gameplay item enhancing perks of the area. <b><a href="http://wiki.xileretro.net/index.php?title=World_Boss" target="_blank">World Boss</a></b> has gotten a major Revamp. Weve got new World Boss sprites and monster changes, new skills added to them and the Treasure has been made more visible as well!. The Reward pool has been slightly tweaked in the better direction and our Event Queue for it has been better optimized to minimize any issues found from World Boss dual checks. PvP Room has been given a facelift and that means new maps and more content surrounding it. @pvp, @go 15, and @warp arug_que01 are all ways to gain access and you can warp in and out as you see fit. An NPC in Center Prontera now exists and will reflect how many players are in the PvP Room!
